# Where DYLD You Hide?
Leveraging the Mach-O Format and the iOS Dynamic Linker For Advanced Injection Techniques and Research.

[Barak Aharoni - Appdome Speedtalk at ROOTCON18](https://youtu.be/EqMCGSapqn4?si=qMT8Jehza-trRTuF)

# Abstract
This presentation delves into the iOS Mach-O executable format and the Dynamic Linker (dyld), highlighting their roles in application execution and linking.
It will examine how dyld's behavior can be utilized for code injection and runtime manipulation, focusing on dynamic library injection techniques. 

Advanced debugging methods will be examined to understand application behaviors prior to execution, along with research methodologies of resolving and using private APIs. Real-world examples will demonstrate these techniques, covering their application in both legitimate contexts and potential malicious uses. The session will also address the security implications of these methods and present current mitigation strategies and best practices for protecting iOS applications.

This presentation aims to provide valuable insights for developers and security researchers in navigating and defending against malicious techniques within the iOS environment.
